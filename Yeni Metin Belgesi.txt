An interactive art installation called "Echoes" is currently on display at a museum in Istanbul, offering visitors an immersive experience.

The sculpture, created by renowned artist Murat Öztürk, consists of multiple interconnected metal rods suspended from the ceiling. Each rod is equipped with sensors that can detect the movement and proximity of individuals within its range. As visitors walk around the installation, their presence triggers a series of sound waves that reverberate through the space, creating a unique audiovisual spectacle.

The concept behind "Echoes" is to explore the relationship between human presence and the environment. By encouraging interaction and engagement, the artwork aims to blur the boundaries between the viewer and the art piece itself. It invites visitors to become active participants, shaping and influencing the evolving soundscape with their movements.
